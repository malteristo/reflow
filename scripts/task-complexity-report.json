      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the ChromaDB Vector Database Integration task into 10 subtasks, focusing on the core functionality required for proper integration. Include subtasks for database connection, schema design, CRUD operations, query optimization, metadata handling, collection management, error handling, transaction support, testing infrastructure, and documentation. For each subtask, provide a clear title, description, and detailed implementation requirements following strict TDD principles.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to several factors: it requires implementing a complete vector database integration with ChromaDB, handling complex metadata schemas, supporting different collection types, and following strict TDD requirements. The task already has 7 subtasks, but 4 are completed and 3 are pending. The remaining work includes document insertion, query optimization, and integration testing, which are substantial components. The detailed requirements for TDD methodology add another layer of complexity, requiring careful test planning before implementation."

Include detailed requirements for the abstract base class design, local embedding service implementation, API embedding service, batch processing optimization, model caching mechanisms, model change detection, performance benchmarking, and comprehensive testing. Each subtask should follow strict TDD methodology with clear RED-GREEN-REFACTOR phases and 100% test coverage requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing embedding services with multiple model support and strict TDD requirements. It already has 6 subtasks covering the core functionality, but could benefit from additional subtasks focused on performance optimization and model caching. The complexity comes from handling different embedding models, implementing both local and API-based services, managing batch processing efficiently, and ensuring proper model change detection - all while maintaining strict TDD discipline."

For each subtask, specify clear requirements, dependencies, and testing criteria with a focus on preserving document structure and rich metadata extraction.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a sophisticated document processing pipeline with Markdown-aware chunking and rich metadata extraction. It involves complex algorithms for header-based segmentation, recursive chunking, and special handling for code blocks and tables. The task already has 7 subtasks, but could benefit from additional subtasks focused on performance optimization and integration with the vector database. The complexity stems from the need to preserve document structure while creating optimal chunks for embedding and retrieval."

Include components for model initialization and configuration, single result re-ranking, batch processing optimization, integration with retrieval pipeline, and comprehensive testing. For each subtask, specify clear requirements for performance optimization, CPU efficiency, and integration with the existing system architecture.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a re-ranking service using cross-encoder models to improve retrieval precision. While technically complex, it's more focused than some other tasks, dealing primarily with model integration and optimization. The task currently has no subtasks, suggesting it needs proper decomposition. The complexity comes from optimizing for CPU performance, implementing batch processing, and ensuring seamless integration with the retrieval pipeline."

Include components for command structure design, configuration management, logging system, error handling, command routing, and help documentation. For each subtask, specify clear requirements for usability, error reporting, and integration with downstream components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating the main CLI application structure with command routing and error handling. It's moderately complex as it requires setting up the foundation for all CLI commands, implementing global options, and establishing error handling patterns. The task currently has no subtasks, indicating a need for decomposition. The complexity is moderate because while CLI frameworks like Typer simplify implementation, proper error handling and user experience design still require careful planning."

For each subtask, specify clear requirements for accuracy, performance, and integration with the vector database and embedding services.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves building the main query processing engine with vector search and re-ranking capabilities. It's highly complex as it represents the core RAG functionality that ties together multiple components (embedding generation, vector search, re-ranking). The task already has 8 subtasks, but could benefit from additional subtasks focused on performance optimization and integration testing. The complexity stems from the need to implement a complete RAG pipeline with multiple stages, each requiring careful optimization and integration."
