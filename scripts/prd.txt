Document Version: 2.0

Date: May 23, 2025

Status: Draft

Overview:

This document outlines the product requirements for the Research Agent, an AI-powered assistant designed to integrate with the Cursor IDE. The Research Agent will leverage a local knowledge base of research documents to help software developers and technical writers improve Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and Software Design Documents (SDD). It will provide contextual recommendations, identify knowledge gaps, and facilitate a continuous learning loop by allowing users to augment its knowledge base. The Research Agent will utilize the Model Control Protocol (MCP) for communication between the Cursor IDE and its backend services, drawing architectural inspiration from tools like claude-task-master. This version 2.0 incorporates findings from in-depth design research to refine technical specifications and enhance user experience.

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to define the scope, features, and functionalities of the Research Agent. It serves as a guiding document for the design, development, and testing phases, ensuring that the final product aligns with the project's vision and user needs. This PRD will detail the product's goals, target audience, specific requirements, user stories, and technical considerations, updated with insights from recent design research.

### **1.2 Project vision**

To empower software development teams by providing an intelligent, integrated research assistant within their primary development environment (Cursor IDE). The Research Agent aims to streamline the process of consulting and applying research findings to software design and specification documents, thereby improving the quality, consistency, and knowledge-backed foundation of software projects. It will achieve this by making relevant information readily accessible and actionable, fostering a more informed and efficient development lifecycle.

### **1.3 Scope**

The scope of this project includes the development of:

* A backend CLI application (primarily in Python) for knowledge base management (ingestion, processing, storage) and RAG-based querying, including re-ranking.  
* An MCP server (potentially Node.js) to act as an intermediary between the Cursor IDE and the backend CLI.  
* Configuration mechanisms for system settings (including chunking strategies), API keys, and knowledge base parameters.  
* A Cursor rules file (design\_researcher\_rules.mdc) to define the AI agent's persona and detailed interaction logic within the Cursor IDE, including context extraction and query refinement flows.

The project will *not* include:

* Development of a standalone GUI outside of the Cursor IDE.  
* Real-time collaborative editing features for documents.

## **2\. Product overview**

The Research Agent is a sophisticated tool designed to seamlessly integrate into a developer's workflow within the Cursor IDE. It acts as an AI-powered "design researcher," assisting users in enhancing their SRS and SDD documents.

At its core, the Research Agent leverages a locally stored, curated knowledge base composed of .md research reports and other textual information. Users can populate and manage this knowledge base, categorizing information into "fundamental" or "project-specific" collections. The system will employ a hybrid chunking strategy for .md documents, combining Markdown-aware splitting with recursive character splitting to optimize for semantic coherence while respecting document structure. Rich metadata will be extracted and stored with each chunk.

When a user is working on an SRS or SDD in Cursor and needs design recommendations, they can query the Research Agent via natural language in the Cursor chat. The agent, guided by its design\_researcher\_rules.mdc file, extracts relevant context from the active document and the user's prompt. It then uses MCP to communicate with its Python-based backend CLI, which performs a vector search using ChromaDB as the default local vector store and sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 as the default local embedding model. Retrieved results are then re-ranked using a lightweight cross-encoder to improve precision before being returned.

The Cursor agent presents these refined findings or recommendations, including enhanced relevance indicators like keyword highlighting and structural context. If knowledge is insufficient, the Research Agent can suggest external searches (e.g., Perplexity) or help formulate deep research prompts. An interactive query refinement loop, involving feedback from the backend to the Cursor AI, will help users narrow down broad queries. New insights can be added back into the knowledge base, enabling continuous learning.

* **FR-FC-002 (New): Abstracted Embedding Service:** Embedding generation module in the backend should be abstracted to potentially support a team-hosted centralized embedding service in the future.

## **6\. User stories and acceptance criteria**

(User stories from V1.0 will be reviewed and updated based on the refined requirements. New stories reflecting re-ranking, enhanced feedback, iterative query refinement, and new configuration options will be added. Example modifications and additions below.)

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Knowledge Base Management** |  |  |
| ST-101 | (As V1.0, ACs to ensure Python backend & ChromaDB use, and hybrid chunking with rich metadata) | \- ... (original ACs) ... \&lt;br\> \- And the backend Python CLI processes the files. \&lt;br\> \- And documents are chunked using a hybrid strategy (Markdown-aware by headers, then recursive for prose). \&lt;br\> \- And code blocks/tables are handled atomically if possible. \&lt;br\> \- And rich metadata (source, title, header hierarchy, content type, etc.) is stored with each chunk in ChromaDB. \&lt;br\> \- And the default embedding model (multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1) is used. |
| ST-105 | (Database Modelling \- As V1.0, ensure it reflects ChromaDB and rich metadata fields) | \- ChromaDB is used as the vector store. \&lt;br\> \- Schema within ChromaDB collections includes fields for text, embedding vector, and metadata: source\_document\_id, document\_title, header\_hierarchy (structured e.g., JSON), chunk\_sequence\_id, content\_type, code\_language (if applicable). \&lt;br\> \- Metadata fields are queryable/filterable as supported by ChromaDB. |
| ST-106 (New) | As a Developer, when I change the configured embedding model in researchagent.config.json, I want the system to inform me that existing KBs need re-indexing for compatibility and offer to do so. | \- Given I have an existing KB indexed with model\_A. \&lt;br\> \- When I change researchagent.config.json to use model\_B. \&lt;br\> \- And I attempt a query or an agent interaction that accesses the KB. \&lt;br\> \- Then the agent informs me: "The embedding model has changed. Existing collections were indexed with model\_A. To use them with model\_B, they need to be re-indexed. Would you like to re-index \[collection\_name / all collections\] now?" \&lt;br\> \- And if I confirm, the system re-processes and re-embeds documents in the specified collections. |

I found potential information related to 'microservices', 'data pipelines', and 'API design'. Would you like to focus on any of these keywords or a specific section of your document?" (based on structured feedback from backend CLI). \&lt;br\> \- And I can choose a refinement or rephrase my query. |
| ST-406 (New) | As a Developer, I want to provide feedback (thumbs up/down) on the relevance of individual retrieved snippets to help improve future results. | \- When query results are displayed, each snippet has a 👍 and 👎 icon. \&lt;br\> \- When I click 👍 for a snippet, my positive feedback is logged by the system. \&lt;br\> \- When I click 👎 for a snippet, my negative feedback is logged. \&lt;br\> \- The agent might optionally ask for a quick reason if I click 👎 (e.g., "Outdated," "Not relevant"). |
| **Configuration** |  |  |
| ST-801 | (As V1.0, ACs updated for new default model) | \- The researchagent.config.json file has a section for embedding\_model with provider ("local", "openai", etc.) and model\_name\_or\_path. \&lt;br\> \- Default model\_name\_or\_path for "local" provider is sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1. \&lt;br\> \- The backend Python CLI reads and uses this configured model. |

## **7\. Technical requirements / stack**

### **7.1 Backend CLI application**

* **Language:** **Python**.  
  * *Justification:* Superior NLP/ML ecosystem, ease of integrating sentence transformer models and vector DB clients, robust CLI packaging options, and better alignment for future advanced RAG features.  
* **Key Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  * Vector Database Interaction: `chromadb` (Python client). Secondary consideration for `sqlite3` with a Python wrapper for `sqlite-vec` if ChromaDB proves problematic for some users.  
  * Embedding Generation: `sentence-transformers` library.  
  * Re-ranking: `sentence-transformers` (for cross-encoder models).  
  * `.md` Processing: `python-markdown` or `mistune`, potentially with `LangChain` text splitters (`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`, `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`).  
  * CLI Argument Parsing: `argparse`, `click`, or `typer`.  
  * File System Operations: Standard Python `os`/`pathlib`.

### **7.2 MCP server**

* **Language:** **Python** using the **FastMCP framework** (`jlowin/fastmcp`).  
  * *Justification:* Aligns the MCP server with the Python backend CLI for a consistent development stack. The Python FastMCP implementation is the original and most mature, offering full protocol support, seamless integration with Python ML/AI libraries, advanced deployment options (STDIO, HTTP, SSE), and a clean decorator-based API. This choice is recommended for production-grade deployments and leveraging the full FastMCP feature set.  
* **Function:** Implements MCP tools that interface with the `research-agent-cli` (Python) commands. Handles communication (e.g., via STDIO for local CLI calls, or potentially HTTP if the CLI is exposed as a microservice) between the Cursor AI agent and the backend logic. Formats CLI output (including structured JSON feedback for query refinement) back into a structure the Cursor agent can understand.  
* **Configuration:** Defined in Cursor's `mcp.json` file, specifying the command to run the Python MCP server, arguments, and necessary environment variables. The server itself will use FastMCP's declarative syntax for defining tools.

### **7.3 Vector database**

* **Default Local Option:** **ChromaDB**.  
  * *Justification:* Best balance of ease of setup, developer-friendly API, robust metadata filtering critical for SRS/SDD context, and adequate performance for the target local use case. Apache 2.0 license. Client-server mode offers future pathway for shared KBs.  
* **Secondary Local Option:** SQLite with sqlite-vec (or a similar mature vector extension).  
  * *Justification:* Ubiquitous, minimal dependencies, if sqlite-vec proves mature in combined metadata/vector queries (addressing sqlite-vss limitations).  
* **Configuration in** researchagent.config.json**:** Must support provider ("chromadb", "sqlite") and path for local storage. For future-proofing, schema should anticipate remote DB parameters.

### **7.4 Embedding models**

* **Default Local Model:** sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1.  
  * *Justification:* Small (approx. 80MB), fast on CPU, good for QA/semantic search on technical text, 384 dimensions, easy to deploy via sentence-transformers.  
* **Alternative Local Model (Higher Accuracy):** BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 (or bge-small-en-v1.5 for fewer resources).  
  * *Justification:* Excellent retrieval performance on MTEB, more resource-intensive but offers higher quality embeddings.  
* **API-based Models:** Support for OpenAI, Cohere (as per original PRD) remains, configurable via researchagent.config.json and API keys in .env.  
* **Configuration in** researchagent.config.json**:** Must support provider ("local", "openai", "cohere"), model\_name\_or\_path, api\_key\_env\_var, and model-specific options (e.g., device).  
* **Local Model Management:** Leverage Hugging Face cache via sentence-transformers. Implement a clear mechanism to inform users and prompt for re-indexing of existing collections if the embedding\_model configuration changes.

### **7.5 Document chunking strategy**

* **Default Strategy:** Hybrid approach:  
  * **Markdown-Aware Splitting:** Segment documents using a Markdown parser based on a configurable hierarchy of headers (e.g., H1-H4 using MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter). Associate chunks with their header hierarchy metadata.  
  * **Atomic Unit Handling:** Treat identified code blocks and tables as atomic units if their size is within chunk\_size. If larger, apply specialized splitting rules (e.g., split code by function/class if identifiable, split tables preserving header context for each part).  
  * **Recursive Character Splitting:** Apply to prose sections within header-defined segments to adhere to chunk\_size and chunk\_overlap, respecting sentence/paragraph boundaries where possible.  
* **Configuration (**researchagent.config.json **under** chunking**):**  
  * strategy: (e.g., "markdown\_recursive")  
  * chunk\_size: (Default 512 tokens/characters)  
  * chunk\_overlap: (Default 50 tokens/characters)  
  * markdown\_headers\_to\_split\_on: (e.g., \[\["\#\#", "H2"\], \["\#\#\#", "H3"\]\])  
  * strip\_markdown\_headers: (boolean, default true)  
  * handle\_code\_blocks\_as\_atomic: (boolean, default true)  
  * handle\_tables\_as\_atomic: (boolean, default true)  
* **Metadata Extraction per Chunk:** source\_document\_id, document\_title, header\_hierarchy (structured), chunk\_sequence\_id, content\_type ("prose", "code\_block", "table"), code\_language (if code\_block).

### **7.6 RAG pipeline enhancements**

* **Default Re-ranking:** Implement lightweight re-ranking by default.  
  * **Mechanism:** Initial retrieval from vector DB (top K=10-20 candidates), then re-score using a small, efficient open-source cross-encoder model (e.g., cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2 or mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-xsmall-v1 on CPU). Select top N=3-5 re-ranked chunks.  
  * **Rationale:** Substantially improves precision with manageable local performance overhead.  
* **Future Consideration \- Query Expansion:** Techniques like Multi-Query or HyDE to be considered for future iterations if performant local LLM integration becomes standard; would be an advanced, configurable feature.

### **7.7 Configuration management**

* researchagent.config.json: JSON file in the project root for detailed user-configurable settings as outlined above.  
* .env file: Standard environment variable file for API keys and sensitive credentials.  
* Cursor mcp.json: For MCP server definition and passing environment variables.

### **7.8 Security considerations**

* API keys stored securely (not in version control).  
* Secure communication (HTTPS) for any cloud-based services.  
* Input sanitization for CLI commands (though primarily mediated by Cursor AI).  
* File system access restricted to user-specified directories.

## **8\. User interface**

### **8.1 Primary interface: Cursor IDE chat**

* All interactions via natural language in Cursor chat.  
* Responses formatted with Markdown.

### **8.2 Cursor rules file (**design\_researcher\_rules.mdc**)**

*(Incorporating recommendations from Research-Agent-Design-Research, Section II.2 & III.1, V.2.B, V.2.C)*

* **AI Persona:** Defines "Design Researcher."  
* **Context Extraction from Editor:**  
  * Prioritize user-selected text as document\_context.  
  * If no selection, use cursor position to find nearest preceding Markdown heading (H1-H4) and extract its text and subsequent content (approx. 300-500 words) as document\_context.  
* **Backend Query Formulation:**  
  * Standardize parameters passed to backend: user\_query, document\_context (mandatory); target\_collections, query\_mode (optional).  
* **Handling Ambiguity & Query Refinement:**  
  * Instruct Cursor AI to issue clarification prompts for vague user queries before calling backend.  
  * Guide AI to consider query decomposition for complex user questions if initial backend results are poor.  
  * Define how Cursor AI processes structured feedback from backend (status like "clarification\_needed", message\_to\_user, refinement\_options with suggested\_keywords or suggested\_sections, low\_confidence\_snippets\_preview) to present refinement options and guide the user through an iterative query process.  
* **Knowledge Collection Management Dialogue Flows:**  
  * Define intuitive natural language command patterns for creating (confirming type), deleting (with explicit confirmation), listing (grouped, with project links), and linking/unlinking collections.  
  * Specify clear error handling dialogues for "collection not found," "already exists," etc..

### **8.3 Feedback and error messages**

*(Incorporating recommendations from Research-Agent-Design-Research, Section III.2, V.2.C)*

* **Clarity & Actionability:** Messages must be clear, concise, and suggest corrective actions.  
* **Relevance Indicators for Retrieved Knowledge:**  
  * **Keyword Highlighting:** Emphasize query-matching terms in retrieved snippets.  
  * **Structural Context Display:** Show header path (e.g., "Source: DocX \> Section Y \> Subsection Z").  
  * **Source Document Information:** Display document name with action/link to open in Cursor at the relevant section.  
  * **Qualitative Relevance Labels:** Map scores to "Highly Relevant," "Moderately Relevant," etc..  
  * **Recency/Version Info:** Display if available from metadata.  
* **UI Presentation in Chat:**  
  * Use concise, expandable snippets for retrieved chunks.  
  * Clearly associate metadata (source, structural context, relevance label/score) with each chunk.  
* **User Feedback Actions on Snippets:**  
  * Include 👍/👎 icons next to each retrieved chunk.  
  * Optional: After a "👎" click, offer quick categorical reasons (e.g., "Outdated," "Incorrect Topic").  
  * Logged feedback should be used for future system improvements (FR-KA-003).

## **9\. Future considerations / Scalability**

(Incorporating recommendations from Research-Agent-Design-Research, Section IV, V.1)

While the primary focus of version 2.0 is a robust local-first experience, the following architectural considerations will be made to facilitate potential future evolution towards team-based knowledge sharing:

* **Extensible Database Configuration:** The researchagent.config.json schema for vector\_database will be designed to easily accommodate remote database parameters (e.g., remote\_host, remote\_port, api\_key\_env\_var, team\_id\_namespace) in addition to local paths, supporting a smoother transition if a centralized vector DB is adopted.  
* **Comprehensive Metadata Schema:** Document and chunk metadata will include fields such as user\_id, team\_id, and access\_permissions from the outset. These will be populated with default values (e.g., "local\_user", "private") in the local-first version but will be essential for data ownership, attribution, access control, and multi-tenancy in a shared environment.  
* **Abstracted Embedding Generation Service:** The backend module responsible for generating embeddings will be architected with clear interfaces to allow plugging in alternative embedding providers. This facilitates a future scenario where a team might use a centralized, team-hosted embedding service or a specialized proprietary model not suitable for individual local deployment.
