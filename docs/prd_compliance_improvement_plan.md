## üîç PRD Compliance Monitoring

### **Daily Tracking**:
```bash
# Add to development workflow:
python scripts/prd_compliance_checker.py --requirements FR-KB,FR-RQ,FR-CM
python scripts/cli_completion_audit.py --show-todos
python scripts/mcp_integration_validator.py
```

### **Weekly Reviews**:
- Functional requirement completion percentage
- User story acceptance criteria status
- Integration test coverage by PRD section
- Documentation sync with implemented features

---

**Critical Insight**: Our current improvement plans focused too heavily on fixing existing code rather than completing missing functionality. The PRD parity analysis reveals we need to shift focus to **functional requirement completion** as the highest priority, with test coverage improvement following successful implementation.

*This plan ensures we deliver on the PRD promise rather than just fixing what exists.*
