# Research Agent: Updated Improvement Strategy Summary

> **Based on**: Irregularities analysis + PRD parity review  
> **Key Insight**: Focus on completing missing functionality before fixing existing code  
> **Priority**: PRD compliance over test fixing

## 🎯 Strategic Shift Required

### **Previous Strategy (Incorrect)**
1. Fix failing tests first
2. Improve test coverage 
3. Address code quality issues
4. Complete missing features

### **Corrected Strategy (PRD-Driven)**
1. **Complete missing core functionality** (many tests fail because features don't exist)
2. **Implement all PRD functional requirements** (FR-XXX compliance)
3. **Fix tests for completed features** (now they have something to test)
4. **Achieve quality targets** (coverage, performance, etc.)

## 🚨 Critical Gaps Identified (Not in Previous Plans)

### **Missing Core Components**
1. **Cursor Rules File** - `.cursor/rules/design_researcher_rules.mdc` (FR-SI-004)
   - AI persona definition
   - Context extraction logic
   - Query formulation strategies

2. **Interactive Query Refinement** - (FR-RQ-009)
   - Structured feedback system
   - Query confidence scoring
   - Refinement suggestions

3. **Knowledge Gap Detection Integration** - (FR-IK-001-003)
   - Gap identification algorithms
   - Perplexity API integration
   - Research prompt generation

4. **User Feedback System** - (FR-KA-003)
   - Thumbs up/down collection
   - Feedback storage and analysis
   - System improvement integration

5. **Model Change Detection Integration** - (FR-KB-005)
   - Config change detection
   - Re-indexing prompts
   - Automated collection reprocessing

## 📋 Immediate Actions (This Week)

### **Day 1-2: Core Pipeline Completion**
```bash
# HIGHEST PRIORITY: Make core functionality work
1. Complete document_processor hybrid chunking implementation
2. Implement functional RAG query engine with vector search
3. Fix ChromaDB integration issues
4. Complete embedding service implementations
```

### **Day 3-5: CLI Command Completion**
```bash
# CRITICAL: Replace all "Not implemented yet" returns
1. knowledge_base.py - Document ingestion commands
2. projects.py - Project management commands  
3. query.py - Query processing commands
4. collections.py - Collection management commands
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics (Updated)

### **Week 1 Goals**
- [ ] Zero "Not implemented yet" CLI responses
- [ ] Document ingestion produces chunked content with metadata
- [ ] RAG queries return actual vector search results
- [ ] All PRD functional requirements have working implementations

### **Week 2 Goals**  
- [ ] All user stories pass acceptance criteria
- [ ] MCP-CLI integration fully operational
- [ ] Cursor rules file enables design researcher interactions
- [ ] Query refinement loop functional

### **Week 3 Goals**
- [ ] Test failures reduced from 319 to <50 (features now exist to test)
- [ ] Test coverage increases to 85%+ (testing completed features)
- [ ] Integration tests pass with working components

## 🔧 Implementation Order

### **Phase 1: Functional Implementation (Weeks 1-2)**
Focus on making things **work** before making them **perfect**

### **Phase 2: Quality & Testing (Week 3-4)**
Fix and optimize **after** core functionality exists

### **Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Week 5-6)**
End-to-end validation and performance optimization

## 📊 Key Files Requiring Immediate Attention

### **Core Implementation Gaps**
| File | Current State | Required Action |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| `document_processor/chunking/chunker.py` | Placeholder | Complete hybrid chunking |
| `rag_query_engine.py` | 1,479 lines with mocks | Complete RAG pipeline |
| `cli/knowledge_base.py` | 1,734 lines, many TODOs | Replace all placeholders |
| `cli/projects.py` | 809 lines with TODOs | Complete implementation |
| `cli/query.py` | 949 lines incomplete | Full query pipeline |

### **Missing Components (Not in Current Codebase)**
| Component | PRD Requirement | Action Required |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `design_researcher_rules.mdc` | FR-SI-004 | Create from scratch |
| Query refinement system | FR-RQ-009 | Design and implement |
| User feedback collection | FR-KA-003 | Add to result formatter |
| Perplexity integration | FR-IK-002 | External API integration |

## 🏆 Why This Strategy Will Succeed

1. **Addresses Root Cause**: Test failures due to missing functionality, not broken code
2. **PRD Compliance**: Ensures we deliver what was promised in requirements
3. **User Value**: Completes features users actually need
4. **Quality Foundation**: Tests validate real functionality, not mocks

## 🚦 Quality Gates (Revised)

### **Before Phase 2 (Testing)**
- [ ] All PRD functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All CLI commands operational
- [ ] Core RAG pipeline functional end-to-end
- [ ] MCP-CLI integration working

### **Before Production**
- [ ] 95% test coverage on completed features
- [ ] Zero critical failures
- [ ] All user stories validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

---

**Bottom Line**: We have a great architecture but need to complete the construction. Focus on building functionality first, then perfecting it through testing and optimization.

*This strategy prioritizes user value delivery over internal code quality metrics.*
